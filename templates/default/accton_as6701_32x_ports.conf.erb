#
# accton,as6701_32x has:
#     32 QSFP+ ports numbered 1-32
#         These ports are configurable as 40G or split into 4x10G ports.
#
#     The X pipeline covers QSFP ports 1-11, 24-26, 30-32 and the Y pipeline
#     covers QSFP ports 12-23, 27-29.
#
#     The Trident2 chip can only handle 52 logical ports per pipeline.
#
#     This means 12 is the maximum number of 40G ports you can ungang
#     per pipeline. The 12 40G ports become 48 unganged 10G ports,
#     plus the remaining 4 40G ports totals 52 logical ports for that
#     pipeline.
